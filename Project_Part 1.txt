# Chen_CSCI2270_FinalProject

#This is a file that describes the design of the final project.
In this project, I want to create a program that collect the distances between
different airports and calculate the shortest path between them. The function
would ask user to input their current location and their destination, then calculate
all possible paths, and the program would print out the traveling information for
user.

  In my program,I will be using including but not limited to graph, hash tables,
 queue etc. There would be at least seven options in the main menu.
