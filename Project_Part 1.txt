# Chen_CSCI2270_FinalProject

#This is a file that describes the design of the final project.
In this project, I want to create a program that collect the distances between
different airports and calculate the shortest path between them. The function
would ask user to input their current location and their destination, then calculate
all possible paths, and the program would print out the traveling information for
user.

  In my program,I will be using including but not limited to graph, hash tables,
 queue etc. The graph would store the locations
 of airports. Then I might be using algorithm like BFS to 
 find the shortest path. Hash tables store other informations 
 of each airport.
 
 There would be at least seven options in the main menu like adding/deleting an airport, finding 
 an airport and checking its information, creating a path between two places.
